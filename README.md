# ORACLE-SQL: STUDENT_EVALUATION_APPLICATION
This project aims to create a student evaluation system using Oracle SQL to create the data structures and Oracle Apex to create applications to promote ease of access. The primary and bridge tables are created using SQL queries with their respective primary and functional keys. The application is made so that the student can input their evaluation, which then leads the administrators, instructors, and students to the ratings of professors. The information retrieved from these forms would enable administrators to appraise the professor's salary while allowing the administrator to improve their performance. The application system would assist the students in enrolling in their desired courses based on the ratings.
This document goes through the ER-diagram used to convey the overall structure of the database, followed by the SQL queries used to create the database and then the screenshots of the application pages created in Oracle Apex along with the  SQL queries.
